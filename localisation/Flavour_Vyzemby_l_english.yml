 vyzemby_flavour.0.t:0 "First Contact"
 vyzemby_flavour.0.d:0 "A strange ship has arrived from a far off land, carrying a group of halfling explorers who claim to be from the Free City of Beepeck in the Empire of Anbennar. Their arrival is a momentous occasion, as it represents a reunion of two halfling communities that have been separated for ten thousand years. At first, conversation is stunted and awkward. However, when a cook brought a fresh plate of grilled tond from the kitchens - fish prepared in the traditional halfling manner - the sailors went silent, mouths watering. The Vyzemby present exchanged glances, recognizing these strangers for who they really were - fellow halflings who, after a long time at sea, wished to eat a hearty, familiar meal in good company. All at once, tables were pushed together, the court singer sang their finest melody, and a raucous feast was held that lasted well into the night."

 vyzemby_flavour.2.t:0 "An Intellectual Rebirth"
 vyzemby_flavour.2.d:0 "Following the discovery of our Cannorian brothers, an intellectual blossoming has occurred in [Root.GetName]. Cultural exchange has caused a revolution in Vyzemby scholarly thinking. Pursuits such as poetry and the arts that have stagnated in rigid forms for centuries have seen waves of innovation inspired by foreign influence. Cannorian innovations such as sheet music, the guitar, and the bassoon has sparked a level of artistic dynamism not seen in centuries. It is truly a golden age for Vyzemby culture."
 vyzemby_flavour.2.a:0 "A glorious flourishing of culture!"
 vyzemby_flavour.3.t:0 "Spread of Printing"
 vyzemby_flavour.3.d:0 "As trading voyages led by Cannorian halflings have become a familiar sight on our shores, the language barrier has become more and more of an issue. The language they speak, which they call “common”, has no relation to our own, making it difficult for a Vyzemby to learn it with any degree of fluency. One Cannorian, however, has a solution. They generously gifted [Root.GetName] with a schematic of a device they called a “printing press”. They explained that this allowed for the mass production of books, which until now were far too expensive for common use. The local burghers of [Root.GetCapitalName] immediately saw the potential in this “printing press” and have begun producing copies of a Vyzemby-Common translation guide."
 vyzemby_flavour.3.a:0 "What a splendid idea!"

 vyzemby_flavour.4.d:0 "Fishermen on their way to make their morning catch spotted a strange sight on the shore of [shipwreck_location.GetName]. A ship bearing foreign markings has run aground on a local beach. The lizards that stagger out explain that they are traders from [shipwreck_country.GetName] and they were forced to land due to a violent storm. The traders insist on being on their way as soon as possible to deliver their cargo of banana beer. They request assistance in getting their ship back into the water. Alternatively, their cargo could be put to better use elsewhere…"

 vyzemby_flavour.5.t:0 "The Fahvanosy Marathon"
 vyzemby_flavour.5.d:0 "Halflings are renowned for their endurance, being among the first to till the soil after the Day of Ashen Skies. Foot races have been a popular pastime among our people for centuries, with athletes such as Volana Cliffleaper rising to national or even international prominence. The division of Fahvanosy under squabbling clans have limited the length of these races to a relatively small distance. With the island unified under our rule, the idea of a foot race spanning the entire island has become a realistic possibility. To lend prestige to this new endeavor, racers are asking the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for an official endorsement of a yearly race."

 vyzemby_flavour.6.d:0 "Since first contact with the Cannorians, vigorous cultural exchange has occurred. One of our traditions that has fascinated the Cannorians is our yearly marathon across Fahvanosy. As Beepeck occupies a relatively small area in the Empire, they never had the opportunity for such a long race. This year, the trading ships have brought someone unusual. Edmund Dewfoot claims he is the foremost halfling runner in Cannor, and has come to challenge Volana Cliffleaper for her title. Edmund Dewfoot, unsurprisingly, finished last, unprepared as he was for the terrain and climate of Fahvanosy. However, he promised that he would return next year with a group of like-minded Cannorians. It seems our athletes now have international competition."
