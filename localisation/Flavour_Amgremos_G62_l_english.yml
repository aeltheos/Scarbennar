 G62_pirate_talk_title:0 "Pirate Talk"
 G62_pirate_talk_desc:0 "Our port is lost, reduced to a hub for pirates to gather. Townsfolk cower helplessly as the pirates enrich themselves by stealing from the Andic Trade, and we have neither forces nor funds sufficient to expel them. Then again, the pirates haven’t harmed the civilians or raided the village itself, and they make more money than mere wood could ever bring us.\n\nMaybe… maybe we can negotiate."
 G62_andic_navy_title:0 "Andic Navy"
 G62_andic_navy_desc:0 "Our deal has brought great benefits. Amgremos prospers as her former occupants loot ship after ship.\n\nUnfortunately, while the negotiations were successful, our new allies are still pirates. The more of them there are, the more they raid, occasionally even hitting friendly forces. Apologies and reparation notwithstanding, they must be controlled.\n\nWe must hoist the black flag ourselves to be efficient and profit without losing ships on a daily basis."
 G62_clash_of_seas_title:0 "Clash Of Seas"
 G62_clash_of_seas_desc:0 "The nightmare of war is very different from the short raids and sacks familiar to pirates, and the crews are nervous as the Anisikheian ships draw ever closer. Admiral Amarien Bonná stands on the quarter deck and screams to her crew.\n\n'It is us they fear, mateys! Summon the courage that drove you to conquer the seas, and taste the freedom they would take from you! Today we fight, so tomorrow we can sack their palaces, hang those who hung us, and tear down their damned tyrants' statues!\n\nHoist the colors! To hell and back with gold!'"
 G62_great_pirate_empire_title:0 "Great Pirate Empire"
 G62_great_pirate_empire_desc:0 "Amgremós has been transformed from a backwater port dominated by pirates, to the home of a grand corsair fleet.\n\nAll in our reach, from hamlet to cities, have been plundered mercilessly. The pirates have grown from a ramshackle flotilla to a glorious armada of pirates, golden ships decorated with the finest silk, with each clan’s banner waving just below the great purple ensign of the first independent nekheis. Anisikheion has fallen, and Amgremós rules the Cleaved Sea. Just as a shark follows blood, we seek gold.\n\nBe careful in what waters you tread.\n\nYou just might get bit."
 G62_wood_for_everyone_title:0 "Wood For Everyone"
 G62_wood_for_everyone_desc:0 "Amgremos’ terrain is rough, ragged, and not suited for large-scale farming. The trees of Amgremos, however, are large and durable to withstand the harsh environment, and provide the Amgremosi a reliable source of building materials. Amgremos was built on the wood from these forests, but the grain from our overlord has stopped coming, and wood alone will not fill our bellies. Finding a market for this wood though could!"
 G62_silk_market_title:0 "Silk Market"
 G62_silk_market_desc:0 "The demand for silk grows with the city, week after week. Fortunately, so too grow the mulberry orchards. The youths that brought the silk to us are now landed Amgremosi gentry carrying the Kimabhen sericulture tradition, but if we want to expand this industry beyond decentralized village orchards, we should alot them more land and promote more commoners to work for and learn from them.\n\nGoods are worthless without markets, and if we are to compete with our cousins in Kimanis, we must create the infrastructure of a true empire of silk, complete with enough sailors, ports, and warehouses to grow the trade to new heights."
 G62_surf_wax_amgremos_title:0 "Surf Wax Amgremos"
 G62_surf_wax_amgremos_desc:0 "Surfing is a common pass-time of many Amgremósi, thanks to the rough waves of the southern Andic Reach. The sport is not an easy one, requiring great understanding of the water, and control of the board.\n\nSimilarly, a captain must know the waves he rides with, and a strong hand over his ship, lest he fall asunder. Thus, let us make sure we don’t lose control."
 G62_silk_ships_spinneys_title:0 "Silk, Ships and Spinneys"
 G62_silk_ships_spinneys_desc:0 "Strong wood, great ships, and merchants sailing the ocean in the name of Amgremos. \n\nWith this great fleet, the port of Amgremós has been restored, with trade now overflowing the city. Wealth and prosperity not seen since the fall of Kimanis, that could bring a tear to the most proud of the Amgremósi. \n\nIt is now time to cement the privateer fleet into the history of the Kheionai."
 G62_a_new_beginning_title:0 "A New Beginning"
 G62_a_new_beginning_desc:0 "The nekheís were always reliant on their colonial overlords. Being small city states with the threat of constant attacks from the Bashobhar peoples, they survived largely due to the food and armies supplied.\n\nAmgremos is no exception. Our poor soil meant our next meal came only thanks to our mother city Kimanis. Once they fell to Degakheion and Oktikheion though… the food halted, and Amgremos faltered. With no lifeline, the city has fallen into disrepair, and the once lively port fell into sadness.\n\nNow though, it's time to bring ourselves back from the brink."
 G62_searching_for_scraps_title:0 "Searching For Scraps"
 G62_searching_for_scraps_desc:0 "People are well aware of our relations with pirates. They believe that we are pirates ourselves, a scoundrel navy searching for bleeding waters only to get killed by a bigger fish. Unfortunately for our nearby neighbors, piracy doesn’t just mean the ocean. We can steal on the land as well!Apihoxi, our neighbors, flaunt their grain at our hungry bellies. Without proper farms, we \n\nstruggle to maintain our population. They on the other hand have miles of beautiful farmland, producing tons of grain each year. They believe themselves safe under the wise men of Lokemeion.. The pirates of Amgremós are itching to say otherwise…"
 G62_war_for_grain_title:0 "War For Grain"
 G62_war_for_grain_desc:0 "Although we have managed to expand our grain supply, we risk hunger in winter. Yet, wee can’t afford another raid. Not when Apihoxi and their overlords in Ormam have begun militarization along the border.\n\nA raid simply won’t do. What we need is a full out war. The Apihoxi forces are weaker than us, and the Ormami will take too long to cross the sea. Once they arrive, they’ll be too late.\n\nIt's time to make sure we never go hungry again."
 G62_staking_our_claim_title:0 "Staking Our Claim"
 G62_staking_our_claim_desc:0 "Ever since we have taken Apihoxi from Ormam, the Kheionai have begun to reconsider us. They realize we are no longer an orphaned, dying colony. As a result, they blockade our trade and are deliberately trying to debilitate our nation, acting as if they still hold all of the Devand with a tight grip.\n\nThe truth is that their strength is waning. Their ability to secure control of the nekheis weakens with each captured ship, and each port blockaded. They cannot keep something they cannot reach, and each day the Devand drifts further away.\n\nIt's time we take a stand for ourselves."
 G62_free_flame_title:0 "Free Flame"
 G62_free_flame_desc:0 "Amgremós freedom shines amongst the nekheis like a burning flame.\n\nSurrounding us lies their cousins, shrouded in darkness by their overlords, never to see the truth of freedom. Why should our cousins be restrained by weak rulers who do not understand the life of the Devandi nekheis?\n\nThe flame has already been lit, so before it can be put out, let us light the rest of the Devand ablaze."
 G62_the_great_labors_title:0 "The Great Labors"
 G62_the_great_labors_desc:0 "Self sufficiency was something Amgremos has strived for. Devoted ourselves to the cause of strengthening our nation against a constant tide of disaster and failure. But our own success is not enough. Not when the  rest of our brethren languish, slavishly dependent on the Kheionai.\n\nTo the men, women, and children of Apihoixi! Eneion! Keyolion! Empkeios! Stand united, for today we rise as high as the heavens themselves!"
 G62_freeing_deyeion_title:0 "Freeing Deyeion"
 G62_freeing_deyeion_desc:0 "Deyeion, a prison colony to Degakheion, and a brother to Amgremos. Despite stemming from different colonizers, we’ve always had a strong relationship thanks to our shared isolation and struggles. Even when our overlords came to clash, we remained stalwart to our friendship, only ever halfheartedly opposing each other.\n\nNow though, as Degakheion seeks to rein in their colonies, Deyeion draws closer to simply becoming another province in Degakheion. If we are to save our brother from the depths, we must take up our arms against the Dega, and liberate them from the tyrants in Alecand!"
 G62_finding_peace_title:0 "Finding Peace"
 G62_finding_peace_desc:0 "Peace does not come easy.\n\nDespite our liberation of Deyeion from Degakheion there are many in Deyeion who remain loyal to their former overlords, in particular the families of respected nobles sent to govern the colony in the name of the Dega himself. These powerful families hold control over much of Deyeion, and certainly have the power to be a thorn in our sides…\n\nTo avoid any mishaps, we must deal with them. Of course, it's best not to come off as marauders slaughtering opposition, despite what a few pirates have suggested. Surely we can find a diplomatic solution to this issue instead?"
 G62_preparing_a_mission_title:0 "Preparing A Mission"
 G62_preparing_a_mission_desc:0 "Ameion is the most remote settlement of the Kheionai. Focusing more on their conquests in the Taychend, they claim to hold an empire that would make even the kheions fearful of their power. In recent times though, stagnation has plagued the once bountiful lands of Ameion.\n\nAs brothers, it is our honorable duty to assist the men of the Andic Reach in any way possible. It is time for us to certify our duty to the nekheis of the east, and to send an envoy to Ameion. With gifts and treasures, we may be able to convince the prideful to submit in unity."
 G62_gathering_army_title:0 "Gathering An Army"
 G62_gathering_army_desc:0 "We need an army.\n\nIt is the simplest concept of any state, something that everyone should know. Yet, our army was practically defunct after we gained independence. It could barely serve as a city guard.\n\nEnough! If we are to make ourselves known, a strong military force is required. One to match the other nekheis and perhaps even the Kheionai!"
 G62_uniting_mteibhar_title:0 "Uniting The Mteibhar"
 G62_uniting_mteibhar_desc:0 "The Mteibhar are a welcoming people, allowing kheionai merchants to enter their lands, sell goods, and share ideas. To Amgremos, they are great friends, for they have given us a tie to trade and goods when we needed them most. Now, facing the threat of invasion, the Mteibhar is placed in a difficult position. Forced to balance the lines of submission and independence, their position in the future of the Devand is unknown.\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, with encroaching armies from Alecand, the Mteibhar may be willing to discuss closer ties to our own nation. Better to be with an ally than an enemy, so let us gather the envoys to have a talk with their king!"
 G62_andic_union_title:0 "Andic Union"
 G62_andic_union_desc:0 "While the nekheis were always distant from their overlords in Alecand, each had their own business to take care of, and their own worries to bother with. In these tumultuous times though, what was once simply a thought has turned into reality, with Amgremós at its head. Through diplomacy and conquest, the smallest of the three ended up ruling them all.\n\nThe Echate League was never an idea set in stone, simply a figment of the imagination to many. Yet here we are. Fantasy is finally becoming reality. Let us proclaim the Echate League, and with it, the prosperity of the Andic Reach."

 thasaros_kheinisi:0 "Thasáros Kheinisí"
 thasaros_kheinisi_desc:0 "A government that represents the close ties of the pirates and government of Amgremós.\n\nPirates have representation in government and are able to take part in nationwide debate and elections. In return, the Amgremósi are granted control of pirates as subject, and are able to organize the pirates as if they were apart of their own navy.\n\nOf course, the pirates will still raid and the Amgremósi will still govern, but this system allows for organization that could have never been found if these two parties were to remain seperate. Now everyone benefits from this relationship, and instead of a small pouch of gold for one, a great ton of gold can be shared by many."
