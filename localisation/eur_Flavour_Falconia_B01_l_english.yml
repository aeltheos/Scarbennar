 falconia.1.t: "The Eclipse"
 falconia.1.d: "Griffith's occultation is alluded to in a Holy See prophecy which states that the appearance of a red lake when the sun "dies five times" heralds the birth of an angel signaling the beginning of an "age of darkness". In a fierce battle with Guts and Griffith, Zodd recognizes Griffith's importance after noticing the young man's Crimson Beherit and so spares him. The Eclipse occurs a year after Griffith is rescued by the Band of the Falcon from his crippling imprisonment in the Tower of Rebirth. On the eve of the occultation, apostles pilgrimage to the event's pre-ordained setting while killing part of the Band of the Falcon on the way. After reaching a point of despair so great as to make a failed attempt at suicide, Griffith activates his Crimson Beherit after Guts commits what Griffith in that moment considers the unforgivable act of touching him.\n The beherit transports Griffith, Guts, and flanking Band of the Falcon members into a temporal junction point where the God Hand manifests with Zodd seemingly being the only present apostle to remain outside the tornado-like portal. Though the intervening Skull Knight believes that Zodd remains guard at the Eclipse's gateway to simply hold the knight off, Zodd clarifies that he additionally has no interest in the "indulgent spree". After the God Hand separates Griffith from the rest of the band, they show him the "reality within conscious realm", relying on his distressed mental state and most burgeoning desire to ultimately compel his offering of the Band of the Falcon as sacrifice. Consequently, the band members are marked with the Brand of Sacrifice by the God Hand member Void, and the present apostles assume their monstrous released forms to slaughter and devour all band members but Guts and Casca. When Griffith's transfiguration is complete, he emerges as the fifth and final God Hand member, thenceforth christened Femto."^
