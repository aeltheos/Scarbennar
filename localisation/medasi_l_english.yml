 medasi.20.t:0 "The Medasi Compromise"
 medasi.20.d:0 "The Medasi of Eastern Sarhal have been little more than puppets of the great Kheterata Empire for centuries. Should any Medasi step out of line, the armies of Kheterata would march south to quash the troublemakers. However, it has been five years since Kheterata lost the upper Sorrow to the gnoll hordes. It is clear that the fate of the Medasi is now in their own hands.\n\nThe Medasi operated on a power sharing system. A khetist governor, sometimes from Kheterat but more often of the local Medawor nobility, would rule in tandem with the local Efergezmu royal family. This structure has remained in place even after the collapse of Kheterata, although nobody is happy with the current system. For the Medawor, the loss of authority with the collapse of Kheterata is terrifying. They could lose their positions of power and find themselves persecuted as foreign khetists should the Efergezmu manage to rally the peasants against them.\n\nHowever a dangerous rumour has been spreading amongst the Efergezmu. They speak of the terrifying prospect of what would happen if the Medawor took full control. A nation ruled solely by those of khetist faith, where all local culture and religion has been stamped out. They call this dreaded future the Terror of Kartakhet, where Horashesh is once and for all forced to become fully khetist.\n\nFor now, the balance of power remains in an uncomfortable equilibrium. But should a single Medasi grow in power too much, the questions of what Horashesh’s future is will become significantly more pressing."
 medasi.20.a:0 "We must ensure the Medawor keep hold of their power if we do not want chaos"
 medasi.20.b:0 "We cannot allow the Terror of Kartakhet to come to pass!"
 medasi.20.tooltip.a:0 "If the Medawor reach over 90 power, we can reform out of the Medasi Compromise and form a new nation"

 medasi.21.t:0 "A Fruitful Proposal"
 medasi.21.d:0 "The majority of the wealth in [Root.GetName] is in the hands of the wealthy Khetist nobility. Their ancestors were settlers from Kheterata who secured vast swaths of the most valuable land  by force. In today’s more civilised age, these descendants continue to secure more land and power through bribes rather than strength, although this less violent method still results in conflict.\n\nThis is exactly what has just happened in [Root.GetName]. Khetist settlers started fencing off large portions of land for their own use. This land was used by local pastoral farmers for generations, and they have complained to the Efergezmu about the issue. The Khetists insist that they will make a much more fruitful use of the land, and have the perfect gift to sweeten the deal."
 medasi.21.a:0 "I’m sure the Khetists will make great use of the land"
 medasi.21.b:0 "That land belongs to the local farmers"

 medasi.22.t:0 "Cat Stew"
 medasi.22.d:0 "After a third poor harvest year in a row, the people of [province] have turned their culinary talents to a new animal: Cats. With a large feral cat population, cat stew became the new meal of choice for a family looking to eat meat for dinner. The Medawor, who consider the cat a sacred animal, demand that you do something about this barbarous practice."
 medasi.22.a:0 "Let them eat cats"
 medasi.22.b:0 "Crack down on the practice"
